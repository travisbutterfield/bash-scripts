# bash-scripts

This repository includes several custom bash scripts that I use for managing ASU Watts college websites. 

These scripts are written for personal use, and therefore do may not work with other people's setups. 

I am currently using a Windows 10 setup with the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2), with the Ubuntu 18.04 distro as my development environment. 

I have found when sharing this code with colleagues, that some changes must be made to the code so that it will work on MacOS. This is mostly due to the fact that many of the GNU tools available in most Linux distros are not available in MacOS by default.

So, while I am happy to share, your individual mileage using these scripts may vary. Feel free to fork this code and alter it as needed.
